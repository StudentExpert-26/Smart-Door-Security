# 🔐 SmartDoor AI – Face Recognition Door Lock System

A real-time, mask-aware, multi-face recognition door lock system using OpenCV, Arduino, and Google Cloud. Designed for secure access control with smart hardware responses and cloud-based logging.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 97%+ face recognition accuracy with or without masks/hijabs
- 👥 Supports multiple faces in the frame
- 🧠 AI-based recognition using LBPH + Haar cascade
- 👁️ Optional blink detection (MediaPipe) for anti-spoofing
- 🔒 Servo motor controls door lock/unlock
- 🚨 Smart LED + buzzer patterns for access feedback
- 🧾 Logs every recognition attempt:
  - ✅ Locally to CSV
  - ✅ To Google Sheets with timestamp and image
  - ✅ Snapshot uploaded to Google Drive
- 🖼️ Face registration via webcam dataset collection
- 🧰 Modular and professional code structure

## 📡 Hardware Setup (via Arduino)

| Component                | Pin |
| ------------------------ | --- |
| Green LED                | D2  |
| Red LED                  | D3  |
| Buzzer                   | D4  |
| Servo                    | D5  |
| (Optional) Motion Sensor | D6  |

Use `pyfirmata` to connect via `COM7` (adjust if needed in `controller.py`).

---

## ☁️ Google Cloud Setup

1. Create service account & download `creds.json`

2. Share your Google Sheet and Drive folder with:

   ```
   facelogger@facerecognitiondoorlock-464323.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   ```

3. Set Drive folder ID in `cloud/drive_uploader.py`

## 🛡 Access Control Logic

| Face Status                | Hardware Action                 | Logging                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| ✅ Recognized               | Green LED, 1 buzz, unlock servo | Logs + Drive snapshot      |
| ❌ Unknown                  | Red LED, 3 short buzzes         | Logs as “Unknown”          |
| ⚠ Spoof Attempt (optional) | Denied + red LED + logging      | Detected via blink absence |
